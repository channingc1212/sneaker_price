# **Project Scope**

## **Overview**
Develop a web scraping tool that enables users to compare prices of their favorite sneakers across major retail websites (e.g., Nike, Foot Locker, Dick's Sporting Goods). This tool will streamline the shopping experience by providing comprehensive price comparisons, ensuring users can make informed purchasing decisions.

## **Core Functionalities**

1. **Item Definition**
   - **Identification:** Accurately identify the specified sneaker based on user-provided descriptions, images, or URLs.
   - **Detailed Specifications:** Allow users to input detailed attributes such as size and color to refine the search. If no additional information is provided, perform a general search to display a broad range of results.

2. **Website Selection**
   - **Automated Suggestions:** Recommend relevant retail websites for price comparison based on the identified sneaker.
   - **User Customization:** Provide the option for users to manually input or select additional websites for comparison.

3. **Price Comparison**
   - **Data Aggregation:** Retrieve and compile price information for the specified sneaker from the selected retail websites.
   - **Display Results:** Present the comparison in a user-friendly format, including:
     - **Price:** Display the current price of the sneaker on each website.
     - **Links:** Provide direct links to the product pages for easy access.
     - **Basic Information:** Include essential details such as availability and any promotional offers.

## **Additional Instructions**

- **Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs):**
  - **Item Identification:** Utilize LLMs to enhance the accuracy of sneaker identification based on user inputs.
  - **Website Recommendations:** Use LLMs to suggest the most relevant and reliable websites for price comparison.
  - **Function Execution:** Implement LLMs to orchestrate the execution of scraping functions or APIs, ensuring efficient and effective data retrieval.

- **Efficiency and Optimization:**
  - Ensure that the integration of LLMs optimizes the overall performance of the tool.
  - Maintain scalability to accommodate additional features or websites in the future.

## **Technical Requirements**

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Development Environment:** Cursor IDE
- **APIs and Libraries:**
  - **OpenAI API:** For leveraging LLM capabilities.
  - **Web Scraping Libraries:** Such as `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `Selenium` (if needed).
  - **Data Handling:** Utilize `pandas` for data manipulation and `Streamlit` for the user interface.

## **User Interface**

- **Simplicity:** Design a straightforward UI that allows users to:
  - Input sneaker details (description, image, or link).
  - Specify additional attributes (size, color) if desired.
  - Select or confirm the retail websites for comparison.
  - View a consolidated comparison of prices with direct access links.

- **Accessibility:** Ensure the UI is intuitive and accessible, providing a seamless user experience.

## **Considerations**

- **Legal and Ethical Compliance:** Ensure that all web scraping activities comply with the target websites' `robots.txt` policies and terms of service.
- **Performance Optimization:** Implement measures to handle potential challenges such as anti-scraping mechanisms, CAPTCHAs, and dynamic content loading.
- **Scalability:** Design the tool to accommodate future expansions, including additional websites and advanced features.
